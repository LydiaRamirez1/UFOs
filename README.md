## Summary

One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering.

A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields.
Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter. Including a button to clear the filters would be a great addition to this webpage.
